# Utilizing the Google Maps API to recreate a GPS app service to also provide road dimensions in realtime when driving.
The purpose of this project is to research and develop a working web application that works like Google Maps (utilizing the Google Maps API) but also including DOT (Department of Transportation) data to add road dimensions. After it's completion, its functionality would be repurposed to possibly assist drivers and autonomous vehicles to correc their path lest they deviate from a lane's center, a route's path, or a road in general in order to provide a safety assisting backup whilst the operator is in motion in a vehicle.

To run, download/clone, run using live localhost service either w/ VSC (Visual Studio Code) or other IDE.
